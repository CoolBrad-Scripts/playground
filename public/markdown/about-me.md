# About Me

## Biography

Hey there! I am a 24-year old graduate of Ball State University. I grew up in northern Indiana for most of my life, and have found a love for computers and programming at a very young age. 

I am a team-oriented person and wish to one day fill a position where I can be looked upon as a leader and viewed as a strength within the company, as well as further advance my communication, managerial, and development skills. 

I wish to fill a position that will challenge my intuition and personal skills to help me become a better leader tomorrow, and each day after.
